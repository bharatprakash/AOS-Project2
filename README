Directions

1. Two ways to start

   	   	a. spawner:start(operation to perform , # of nodes , # of fragments , input file)
		   		i. If input file is absent or the operation is invalid, error will be thrown and will have to start all over again.

		b. spawner:start(# of nodes , # of fragments , input file)
		   		i. If input file is absent, error will be thrown and will have to start all over again.
				ii. Then an appropriate function can be called to do operation (refer the menu).
					Eg, findMax() , updateFragment(FragmentId , [10.5 , 13.65]).

2. It is desirable that in a single execution, only one operation is computed.

3. Output will be directed to "operation + # of node .csv" in same drectory.
   Eg, max100.csv for max calculation for 100 nodes.
   The Output are of the form
   	   	Operation , # number of total messages , # number of total messages at last value , Value
